## Introduction
Salesforce Apex is a powerful programming language tailored for building applications on the Salesforce platform. This guide aims to help developers write robust and scalable Apex code by following industry best practices.

## Apex Best Practices

## Bulkification
Design your code to handle bulk operations. Ensure that triggers and classes can process records in bulk, avoiding unnecessary queries and updates inside loops.

## SOQL and DML Operations
Avoid placing SOQL queries or DML operations inside loops. Perform bulk operations outside the loop to minimize the number of queries and updates.

## Use of Collections
Leverage collections (lists, sets, maps) for efficient processing of multiple records. Properly use these tools to streamline your code.

## Governor Limits
Understand and respect Salesforce governor limits. Code defensively to handle exceptions due to these limits, especially in bulk processing scenarios.

## Exception Handling
Implement proper exception handling. Catch and handle exceptions with meaningful error messages. Log errors for easier debugging.

## Code Comments and Documentation
Add meaningful comments to your code, explaining complex logic or providing context. Use ApexDoc-style comments for classes and methods to generate documentation.

## Descriptive Naming Conventions
Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables, classes, and methods. Enhance code readability and make it easier for others to understand.

## Separation of Concerns
Follow the principle of separation of concerns. Divide your code into logical, modular components with distinct responsibilities.

## Avoid Hardcoding IDs
Avoid hardcoding record IDs in your code. Use dynamic queries to retrieve records based on criteria whenever possible.

## Trigger Handler Pattern
Consider using a trigger handler pattern to keep your trigger logic modular and organized. This helps separate trigger logic from business logic.

## Avoid Recursive Triggers
Prevent recursive triggers by using static variables or trigger context variables to control trigger execution.

## Test Classes and Code Coverage
Always write test classes to achieve at least 75% code coverage. Test various scenarios, including bulk operations, to ensure your code works in different situations.

## Avoid Hardcoding Values
Avoid hardcoding values directly in your code. Use custom settings or custom metadata types for configurable parameters.

## Use Custom Settings or Custom Metadata Types for Configurations
For configurations that might change between environments, use custom settings or custom metadata types. This allows for easy configuration without modifying code.

## Regular Code Reviews
Conduct regular code reviews with peers to get feedback on your code. This helps identify potential issues and ensures consistency in coding standards across the team.
